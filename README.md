Features

1. Need to add something to controll access rights:
 - Only users can edit and delete their comments/tweets.
 - Should only see the option to do so if they have the rights.
 - This is implemented already, but there should perhaps be some sort of access rights management.
2. Create comments.
  - Comments are only seen on the Show tweet.
  - On index it will show the count of comments (and likes).
  - Will also show count of comments and likes in the profile view of tweets.
3. Need pagination on index views.
  - Should probobly implement sooner rather than later (before adding comments)
4. Add ability to add a profile pic.
5. Restyle views so that it matches wireframe.
6. Add a link to my profile.
7. Filter the index to just users that i am following (my feed). 
8. think about taking out bootstrap and jquery and going to a lightweight framework.
